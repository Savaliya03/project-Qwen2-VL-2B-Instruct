📌 project-Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct

A hands-on implementation and experimentation project using Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, a multimodal vision-language model capable of understanding and generating responses from both images and text.

This repository contains code, notebooks, and example data used for interacting with the Qwen2-VL model on custom vision-language tasks.

🚀 Overview

This project explores the Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct model, an instruction-tuned multimodal model designed for combined vision and language understanding.

The notebook demonstrates how to:

Load the model

Provide image + text input

Generate responses

Work with structured QA data
